Aspen is a PHP-based website and application development platform. Not only will
you be able to produce quality results in less time, but your work is kept
modular for amazing portability. Moving entire features between projects is
essentially a drag and drop.

Aspen is flexible enough to handle everything from a simple website to an
enterprise-level application, and it introduces a new level of standardization
across projects. Share features between your own projects. Share with other
developers. The choice is yours.
